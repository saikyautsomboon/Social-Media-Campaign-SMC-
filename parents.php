        Establishing a trustful and non-judgmental dialogue about online experiences encourages teens to share their concerns and seek guidance.
        Parents should regularly discuss the benefits and risks of social media, set mutual expectations, and listen to their children’s perspectives.
        Being approachable and informed can help teens feel comfortable discussing any issues they encounter online.
